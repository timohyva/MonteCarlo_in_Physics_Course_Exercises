# MonteCarlo_in_Physics_Course_Exercises

There are the home work codes for the course named Monte Carlo in Physics, which I took in 2018.

These source files contains the radom sample generation, Monte Calro integral and the mersenne_twister source code for random number generation.

The low level calcultions were impemented by C language, and were compiled to .so labraries. Python was used to illustrate the results and call the labraries.
